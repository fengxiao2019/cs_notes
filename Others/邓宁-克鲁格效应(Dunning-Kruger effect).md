邓宁-克鲁格效应(Dunning-Kruger effect)
![]()
达克效应
一种认知偏差，people believe that they are smarter and more capable than they really are。
为什么会造成这种现象？
poor self-awareness + low cognitive ability =\> overestimate their own capabilities
**Cognitive ability** :   is defined as a general mental capability involving reasoning, problem solving, planning, abstract thinking, complex idea comprehension, and learning from experience (Gottfredson, 1997).
**self-awareness**  : conscious knowledge of one's own character, feelings, motives, and desires.

fools are blind to their own foolishness - Charles Darwin wrote in his book The Descent of Man
"Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge."

yet he prattles on, blithely oblivious to his own ignorance.
关于邓宁和克鲁格进行的研究：让他们的65名参与者对不同笑话的滑稽程度进行评分。
结论：无能的人不仅表现不佳，而且也无法准确地评估和认可自己工作的质量。
Incompetent people are **not only** poor performers, they are also unable to accurately assess and recognize the quality of their own work. 
> > Low performers are unable to recognize the skill and competence levels of other people, which is part of the reason why they consistently view themselves as better, more capable, and more knowledgeable than others
> > In many cases, incompetence does not leave people disoriented, perplexed, or cautious
Consistent with other findings related to the Dunning-Kruger effect, the more familiar participants claimed that they were with a topic, the more likely they were to also claim they were familiar with the meaningless terms
原因：
stems from what they refer to as a "dual burden."
People are not only incompetent; their incompetence robs them of the mental ability to realize just how inept they are
倾向：
- Overestimate their own skill levels
- Fail to recognize the genuine skill and expertise of other people
- Fail to recognize their own mistakes and lack of skill
因此，如果不确定自己是否可以信任自己的自我评估，该怎么做才能对自己在特定领域的能力进行更现实的评估？
- Keep learning and practicing
- Ask other people how you're doing.
- Question what you know
